## Description
CLUE (Conventional Language Units for Evaluation) is a Spanish-English pararell dataset for training and evaluating LLMs in figurative language processing. It is based on the 
Conventional Figurative Language Theory (CFLT) and is composed of metaphors, idioms, similes, and proverbs.

CLUE's bilingual nature allows for a direct comparative evaluation of performance in English versus Spanish, a language with comparatively fewer resources in the field of AI.
The dataset can be used in multiple figurative language processing tasks, such as detection, interpretation, and generation.

The CLUE dataset was developed within the framework of the Master's Thesis "El lenguaje figurado en los LLM: Evaluación y análisis" (Figurative Language in LLMs: Evaluation
and Analysis) at the University of Alicante. The thesis provides a detailed description of CLUE's creation and a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of several
state-of-the-art language models.
